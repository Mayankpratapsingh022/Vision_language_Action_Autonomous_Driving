# Action Chunking Transformer for Autonomous Driving

A language-conditioned deep-learning policy that predicts short sequences of driving controls from a front-camera image, vehicle state, and a written instruction.

The policy is built around an **Action Chunking Transformer (ACT)**. Instead of predicting one steering command at a time, it predicts the next 20 controls together. At the dataset rate of 10 Hz, each chunk covers two seconds of driving. The controller executes a few actions, observes the road again, and replans.

> **Project status:** the dataset and training code are ready, but no GPU training run has been launched. There is no trained checkpoint or claimed driving result yet.

## The learning problem

Autonomous driving is a sequential decision problem. A useful policy has to understand what is visible, remember the current vehicle condition, follow the requested route, and produce controls that make sense together over time.

The model receives:

| Input | Shape | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Front camera | `3 x 128 x 128` | Current road scene, resized from the 256 x 256 source video |
| Vehicle state | `4` | Speed, steering, previous throttle, previous brake |
| Language instruction | Variable text | Requested driving behavior |

It predicts:

| Output | Shape | Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Action chunk | `20 x 3` | 20 future `[throttle, brake, steering]` controls |
| Throttle | Scalar per step | `[0, 1]` |
| Brake | Scalar per step | `[0, 1]` |
| Steering | Scalar per step | `[-1, 1]` |

Language matters here. The first camera frame can look almost identical for "turn left," "continue straight," and "turn right." A vision-only ACT policy cannot know which route the driver requested.

## Model architecture

```

### Vision

A pretrained ResNet-18 keeps the final spatial feature map instead of collapsing it to a single classification vector. At `128 x 128`, the map becomes 16 visual tokens. The backbone is fine-tuned with a smaller learning rate than the policy layers.

### Language

MiniLM encodes the instruction. Its token embeddings are mean-pooled and projected into the ACT transformer width. MiniLM is frozen by default. The dataset is large enough to learn the driving policy, but it is not large enough to teach a language encoder from random initialization.

### Action chunking

Twenty learned queries decode the full control horizon in parallel. This gives the model an explicit two-second control plan rather than a collection of unrelated single-step guesses. During inference, `RecedingHorizonController` executes three actions by default and then requests a fresh chunk from the latest observation.

### CVAE latent

During training, a posterior transformer reads the target action chunk and predicts a latent distribution. This gives ACT a way to model variation between valid demonstrations. At inference time, the latent is set to zero, so the policy output is deterministic for a given observation and instruction.

## Training objective

The policy uses masked action reconstruction plus KL regularization:

```text
loss = masked_L1(predicted_actions, expert_actions) + beta * KL(q(z|a) || N(0, I))
```

The default KL weight is `10.0`. Tail positions near the end of an episode are padded, then removed from both the loss and evaluation metrics with an action mask.

The default optimization setup is:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Optimizer | Fused AdamW on CUDA |
| GPU | RunPod or Modal H100 |
| Batch size | 64 |
| Training steps | 10,000 |
| Policy learning rate | `1e-4` |
| ResNet learning rate | `1e-5` |
| Warmup | 500 steps |
| Schedule | Cosine decay |
| Precision | BF16 |
| Float32 matmul | TF32 enabled |
| Gradient clipping | `1.0` |
| Validation interval | 500 steps |
| Checkpoint interval | 500 steps |

All defaults live in [`configs/base.json`](configs/base.json).

The H100 profile processes `64 x 10,000 = 640,000` training samples. This is the same sample budget as the earlier batch-32, 20,000-step setup. Warmup, validation, checkpointing, and final-test batch counts are scaled with the larger batch, so their sample coverage remains comparable. The learning rates stay conservative for the first real run; batch-size scaling alone is not a reason to double them before a loss curve exists.

## Driving dataset

Training uses [`Mayank022/urban-vla-expert-v1`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Mayank022/urban-vla-expert-v1), a synchronized simulator dataset with camera video, language, vehicle state, and continuous controls.

| Split | Expert episodes | Frames | Hours |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Train | 756 | 224,133 | 6.23 |
| Validation | 162 | 47,614 | 1.32 |
| Test | 162 | 47,933 | 1.33 |

The driving instructions cover left, right, and straight intersection routes, traffic lights, pedestrians, slow-vehicle passing, cut-in yielding, curved-road following, and blocked-lane detours.

The loader follows the supplied split assignments. It does not generate a fresh random split. This keeps held-out world seeds and instruction paraphrases out of training.

The published MP4 files stay at their original `256 x 256` resolution. PyAV resizes each decoded frame directly to `128 x 128` for training. This happens in memory and does not create another dataset folder.

### Recovery and failure data

Controlled recovery demonstrations are part of the expert set. They teach the policy how to return from lateral offsets, heading errors, overspeed, and stalled starts.

The 90 deliberately unsafe episodes under `raw/failures/` are not behavior-cloning targets. They are reserved for analysis. Asking the model to imitate those actions would be the wrong objective.

```

The video loader decodes each episode sequentially and constructs future action chunks in memory. It does not extract hundreds of thousands of PNG files before training.

## Manual RunPod training

This is the simplest RunPod path. Create the GPU Pod in the RunPod dashboard, open its terminal, clone the repository, and execute one Python file. `runpod_main.py` handles Python dependencies, CUDA validation, persistent paths, training, resume, evaluation, logs, and the final Hugging Face upload. It does not create or terminate cloud resources.

### 1. Create the Pod

Use an on-demand H100 SXM or RTX PRO 6000 Pod with:

- image: `pytorch/pytorch:2.8.0-cuda12.8-cudnn9-runtime`
- container disk: at least 30 GB
- Pod volume mounted at `/workspace`: 50 GB
- `HF_TOKEN`: a Hugging Face write token supplied as a RunPod secret/environment variable

Pod-local `/workspace` data survives stopping and restarting the same Pod. It is deleted when that Pod is terminated, so wait for the Hugging Face upload or download the artifacts before termination.

### 2. Clone the repository

In the RunPod web terminal:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y git tmux
cd /workspace
git clone https://github.com/Mayankpratapsingh022/Action_Chunking_Transformer_Autonomous_Driving.git
cd Action_Chunking_Transformer_Autonomous_Driving/act_training
```

The new manual entrypoint must be committed and pushed before cloning.

### 3. Inspect and train

The dry run prints paths and arguments without installing packages or starting training:

```bash
python3 runpod_main.py --dry-run
```

Start a persistent terminal session and launch the full H100 profile:

```bash
tmux new -s act-training

python3 runpod_main.py \
  --run-name act-driving-v1 \
  --max-steps 10000 \
  --batch-size 64
```

Detach with `Ctrl+B`, then `D`. Reattach later with:

```bash
tmux attach -t act-training
```

The first invocation installs the non-Torch requirements and the CUDA 12.8 TorchVision wheel, then verifies the GPU before downloading the dataset. If the selected template does not already contain Torch 2.8, add `--install-pytorch`. On later invocations, `--skip-setup` avoids the pip checks.

### 4. Monitor and resume

From another RunPod web terminal:

```bash
tail -F /workspace/act-driving/logs/act-driving-v1.log
watch -n 2 nvidia-smi
cat /workspace/act-driving/artifacts/status/act-driving-v1.json
```

Rerunning the same command resumes from `/workspace/act-driving/artifacts/runs/act-driving-v1/last.pt`. A successful run evaluates the best checkpoint and publishes the model, tokenizer, metrics, history, and plots to Hugging Face.

## Automated RunPod API setup

RunPod Pods are the recommended path when the account already has RunPod credits. The launcher uses the official REST API and Python's standard library; it does not require the RunPod Python SDK. No GPU is created unless `launch --yes` is used.

### 1. Publish the code

The remote Pod clones the Git repository and branch configured in `.env`. Commit and push these files before launching. The default source is this repository's `main` branch.

### 2. Configure local credentials

Create a RunPod API key in the RunPod console, then prepare the ignored environment file:

```bash
test -f .env || cp .env.example .env
```

Set these values in `.env`:

```dotenv
HF_TOKEN=hf_your_write_token
RUNPOD_API_KEY=your_runpod_api_key
RUNPOD_NETWORK_VOLUME_ID=
RUNPOD_HF_SECRET_NAME=huggingface_token
RUNPOD_GPU_TYPE_IDS=NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3
RUNPOD_GIT_REF=main
```

`RUNPOD_API_KEY` stays on the Mac and authenticates lifecycle API calls. It is never included in the Pod specification or saved state.

In the RunPod console's **Secrets** section, create a secret named `huggingface_token` whose value is the Hugging Face write token. The Pod receives the reference `{{ RUNPOD_SECRET_huggingface_token }}`, not the plaintext value from the local `.env`.

### 3. Create persistent storage

Choose a Secure Cloud data center with H100 availability. Network volumes are tied to one data center, so that selection determines which GPUs can be attached. Create a 50 GB volume through the launcher:

```bash
python3 runpod_launcher.py create-volume \
  --name act-driving-training \
  --size 50 \
  --data-center-id YOUR_DATA_CENTER_ID \
  --yes
```

Copy the returned ID into `RUNPOD_NETWORK_VOLUME_ID` in `.env`. Existing volumes can be inspected with:

```bash
python3 runpod_launcher.py list-volumes
```

Checkpoints, Hugging Face caches, persistent logs, and final artifacts are written below `/workspace/act-driving/` on this volume.

### 4. Inspect and launch

The dry run prints the exact Pod request and never contacts the billable create endpoint:

```bash
python3 runpod_launcher.py launch --dry-run
```

After checking the GPU, image, branch, batch size, and volume ID, launch the on-demand Pod:

```bash
python3 runpod_launcher.py launch --yes
```

The default is one `NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3`, batch size 64, and 10,000 steps. A 12-hour watchdog stops a hung training command; override it with `--timeout-hours` only when necessary. The launcher refuses an accidental second active Pod unless `--allow-duplicate` is explicitly supplied. Spot capacity is available with `--spot`, but it is not recommended for the first training run.

### 5. Monitor and clean up

The launch response is stored in ignored `.runpod/last_pod.json`, without credentials. These commands use that saved Pod ID:

```bash
python3 runpod_launcher.py status
python3 runpod_launcher.py watch
python3 runpod_launcher.py logs
```

`watch` reports lifecycle status and hourly cost. `logs` prints the RunPod dashboard link; container logs carry the trainer's step, percent, loss, learning rate, elapsed time, ETA, and validation events. The same output is retained at `/workspace/act-driving/logs/act-driving-v1.log`.

The training command exits after final evaluation and Hugging Face publishing, releasing the GPU. Verify that the Pod reaches `EXITED`, then delete the Pod record:

```bash
python3 runpod_launcher.py terminate --yes
```

RunPod network-volume Pods cannot be stopped and restarted in place. Termination does not delete the attached network volume.

### 6. Resume or download

To resume, launch again with the same run name, Git branch, and network volume. `resume: "auto"` loads `/workspace/act-driving/artifacts/runs/act-driving-v1/last.pt` with the optimizer, scheduler, scaler, step, and random-number states.

After a successful run, copy the published artifact set back to this machine:

```bash
python3 scripts/download_hf_run.py --run-name act-driving-v1
```

This creates `artifacts/act-driving-v1/`, the layout expected by the inference API.

## Modal setup

Run the setup from the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements-local.txt

hf auth login
modal setup

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set HF_TOKEN. The Modal token fields are optional after modal setup.
```

The Hugging Face token needs write access to [`Mayank022/urban-vla-language-act`](https://huggingface.co/Mayank022/urban-vla-language-act). The local `.env` is ignored by both Git and the Hugging Face publishing script. At launch, only `HF_TOKEN` is transferred to the GPU container as an ephemeral Modal secret.

## Start Modal training

The following command is ready for the first run, but it has not been executed:

```bash
./scripts/start_h100_tmux.sh
```

The launcher reads `.env`, starts a detached `act-h100` tmux session, and writes output to `logs/act-driving-v1.log`. Only `HF_TOKEN` is passed to the GPU container; local Modal credentials are used only by the CLI.

Override the two settings most likely to change during an initial experiment:

```bash
./scripts/run_modal.sh \
  --run-name act-driving-v1 \
  --max-steps 10000 \
  --batch-size 64
```

Watch progress in a second terminal:

```bash
modal app logs urban-vla-language-act-training
```

The logs report the current step, completion percentage, loss, learning rate, elapsed time, ETA, and validation metrics.

## Modal checkpoints and resume

Training writes to the persistent `urban-vla-act-artifacts` Modal Volume. To continue an interrupted run, use the same run name:

```bash
./scripts/start_h100_tmux.sh
```

With `resume: "auto"`, the trainer loads `last.pt` and restores the model, optimizer, scheduler, gradient scaler, step counter, and random-number states.

When training finishes, the local entrypoint downloads the run automatically. A manual download is also available:

```bash
modal volume get urban-vla-act-artifacts \
  runs/act-driving-v1 \
  artifacts/act-driving-v1
```

## Artifacts

```text
artifacts/act-driving-v1/
|-- best.pt                       # Best resumable validation checkpoint
|-- last.pt                       # Latest resumable checkpoint
|-- model.safetensors             # Inference weights
|-- config.json                   # Model architecture and normalization
|-- training_config.json          # Full run configuration
|-- tokenizer/
|-- history.json
|-- metrics.json
|-- logs/train.jsonl
`-- plots/
    |-- training_curves.png
    |-- action_mae.png
    |-- prediction_scatter.png
    `-- sample_chunks.png
```

The completed run is also pushed to Hugging Face. Each run remains under `runs/<run-name>/`, while the best inference weights are copied to the repository root.

## Evaluation

The trainer selects the best checkpoint using validation mean action MAE. It reads the test split once, after model selection.

Reported metrics include:

- masked action L1 over the complete chunk
- throttle, brake, and steering MAE and RMSE
- steering-direction accuracy for meaningful turns
- braking classification accuracy
- simultaneous throttle-and-brake rate
- action MAE for each language intent

These are **open-loop imitation metrics**. A low error means the policy resembles the recorded expert on held-out frames. It does not prove that the vehicle can finish a route.

The next evaluation stage must run the trained policy inside the simulator and measure route success, collisions, off-road time, traffic-light violations, pedestrian violations, control smoothness, and recovery success. Until that closed-loop evaluation exists, the repository should not claim autonomous-driving performance.

## Inference API

After a checkpoint has been downloaded:

```python
import numpy as np

from urban_act.inference import ACTPolicy, RecedingHorizonController

policy = ACTPolicy("artifacts/act-driving-v1")
controller = RecedingHorizonController(policy, replan_interval=3)

camera_rgb = np.zeros((128, 128, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
vehicle_state = np.array([8.2, 0.03, 0.4, 0.0], dtype=np.float32)
instruction = "Turn left at the next intersection."

throttle, brake, steering = controller.act(
    camera_rgb,
    vehicle_state,
    instruction,
)
```

The zero image is only a shape example. Real inference must use the simulator's current RGB frame and synchronized vehicle state.

## Local verification

These checks stay on the CPU. They do not request a RunPod or Modal GPU and do not start training.

```bash
python -m compileall modal_app.py runpod_launcher.py runpod_main.py runpod_train.py src tests scripts
python -m pytest
```

The tests cover configuration validation, dataset split handling, failure-data exclusion, action bounds, deterministic inference, masked loss, and gradient flow through the ACT policy.

## Scope and safety

This is a simulator research project. The images, traffic behavior, vehicle dynamics, and expert controls are synthetic. A model trained here must not be connected to a real vehicle.
